    How much does a treatment session cost?
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p class="transition hidden">
      I am a fee for service provider.  I accept payment via cash, debit  or cheque.  You may have extended insurance which covers the complete or partial cost of treatment.<br /><br />

      I do not bill WSIB.<br /><br />

      I am very aware of the  rising costs in healthcare.  I will try to do the best I can for you in a limited number of treatments.  Generally I see my clients one time weekly.  I will treat the soft tissue or whatever goals we are working on and then provide you with exercises to perform during the week.<br /><br />

      When you are in my clinic for treatment you receive my undivided attention.  I treat only one patient at a time.  I do not pass you off to support staff; I personally provide all of your treatment.<br /><br />

      I take the time required to make lasting change.<br /><br />

      In short, by operating as a fee for service practice, I am able to provide highly specialized treatments that focus upon results.<br /><br />

      Initial  Assessment Rate:  100.00 (60 minutes in duration)<br /><br />

      Treatment Rate:  75.00 (45 minutes in duration)

    How many times per week do I attend?
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Most clients are attending at least 1X weekly for the first few treatments, and then may attend every 2 or 3 weeks for several further sessions.  Treatment is structured according to the client’s needs.<br />

      Spacing enought time between sessions is important.  The treatment does not end after one gets up from the table, the body needs time to process and heal.  Structural  changes  in the body can take weeks to improve. Often what seems like an acute injury is actually many years of dysfunction layered  in the body.   The goal is to help the body move in the direction of healing.

    What can I do to help myself?
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    For manual medicine to be most effective, you also need to be an active participant in your recovery.   Body, mind, emotion and spirit all require nurture and balance.  This can include adequate sleep, exercise or daily movements, dietary changes  and/or lifestyle changes.

    Can you cure my particular issue?
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    Your body is the real healer. I cannot “make” you get better.  I can only cultivate the conditions for health. My role is to help remove the barriers that prevent your body’s healing mechanisms from operating at their fullest functioning.  That being said, I am confident that every client I have worked with would testify to their satisfaction with the results they achieved in working with me.

    What exercises are appropriate between sessions?
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    I may give you  simple movements  as homework which will help to  restore your alignment and function.   If you are already participating in a regular exercise routine, I recommend that you pay close attention to how your body is responding to those exercises.  Generally, I rarely  suggest   limiting your movement as we generally need to move more.  For the heavy strength exercisers,  I do recommend easing off on machine reps and/or  heavy strength training during treatment.
